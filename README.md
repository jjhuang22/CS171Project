## Data Sources: 
Our dataset comes from [Crunchbase](https://public.tableau.com/s/resources?qt-overview_resources=1#qt-overview_resources) - it contains information for nearly 50,000 companies: what markets they operate in, when they were founded, where they're based, how many funding rounds they had, who invested, by whom they were acquired, etc. We also used data from [here](https://public.tableau.com/s/resources?qt-overview_resources=1#qt-overview_resources) to get latitude and longitude coordinates for cities.
