Final Project for Harvard's CS 171 (Fall 2020) 

Data Source: Our dataset comes from [Crunchbase](https://public.tableau.com/s/resources?qt-overview_resources=1#qt-overview_resources) - it contains information for nearly 50,000 companies: what markets they operate in, when they were founded, where they're based, how many funding rounds they had, who invested, by whom they were acquired, etc. We also used data from [here](https://public.tableau.com/s/resources?qt-overview_resources=1#qt-overview_resources) to get latitude and longitude coordinates for cities.  

Directories:
- css: contains library CSS files and our custom style.css

- data: 
	raw data: aquisitions.csv, companies.csv, investments.csv, rounds.csv
	other: contains Jupyter Notebook EDA/scripts, modified CSVs, and custom json files
